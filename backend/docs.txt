This code sets up an Express application that handles payment confirmations, performs transaction verification with Flutterwave, updates a transaction record in a database, and sends a confirmation email with details about the user's purchased plans. Here’s an overview of the flow:

### 1. **Environment Setup**
   - The code begins by loading environment variables using `dotenv` (`require('dotenv').config()`).
   - Several libraries are imported, including:
     - `express`: Framework to handle routing and requests.
     - `body-parser`: For parsing incoming JSON data.
     - `cors`: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
     - `axios`: For making HTTP requests, used for verifying payment via the Flutterwave API.
     - `nodemailer`: For sending emails to users.
     - `winston`: For logging.
     - `rateLimit`: To prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single IP.
     - `sequelize`: ORM for interacting with the database.
     - `Transaction`, `Plan`, and `Code`: Models to interact with the database tables related to transactions, subscription plans, and codes.
     - `sendEmail`: A custom email sending service.

### 2. **Middleware**
   - A rate limiter is set up to allow a maximum of 100 requests per IP every 15 minutes using `express-rate-limit`.
   - CORS is enabled for a specific origin (`http://localhost:5173`), and requests are allowed only for the `GET` and `POST` methods.
   - `bodyParser.json()` is used to parse incoming JSON data in requests.

### 3. **Database Connection**
   - The app establishes a connection to the database using `sequelize.authenticate()`.
   - Once connected, it synchronizes the models with the database using `sequelize.sync()`.

### 4. **Payment Confirmation Endpoint (`/payment-confirmation`)**
   - This endpoint receives a `POST` request with details about the payment, including the transaction reference (`tx_ref`), customer email, plans purchased, transaction type, amount, and customer name.
   - **Validation**: It checks whether all required fields (`tx_ref`, `customerEmail`, `plans`, `type`, `amount`, `customerName`) are present in the request body. If any are missing, it returns a `400` status with an error message.

### 5. **Creating Transaction Record**
   - If the data is valid, a new transaction is created in the database with a `status` set to `0` (Pending).
   - The transaction includes customer email, transaction reference, amount, and name.

### 6. **Verifying Payment with Flutterwave**
   - A function (`verifyTransaction`) is called to verify the payment via the Flutterwave API using the `tx_ref` from the request.
   - The `verifyTransaction` function sends a `GET` request to the Flutterwave API using the `tx_ref` and the secret API key (`flutterwaveKey`) to retrieve the payment status.
   - If the payment is successful (i.e., the verification response indicates success), the transaction status is updated to `1` (Success), and the Flutterwave reference is stored.
   - If the payment is not successful, the transaction status is set to `2` (Failed), and the process ends with a `400` error response.

### 7. **Handling Reseller Case**
   - If the `type` of the transaction is `"reseller"`, the system retrieves the plans purchased by the user, checks if the requested quantity of codes is available, and then:
     - Fetches available codes for the specified plans from the database.
     - Decrypts the codes using a `decrypt` function.
     - Marks the redeemed codes as used in the database (sets `isRedeemed` to `true`).
     - Prepares an email with details about the purchased plans and their corresponding codes.

### 8. **Sending Confirmation Email**
   - After preparing the email content, the app attempts to send an email to the customer using the externalized `sendEmail` function.
   - If sending the email fails, it logs the error and returns a `500` status with a failure message.
   - If the email is sent successfully, it logs a success message.

### 9. **Error Handling**
   - If any error occurs during the process (e.g., transaction creation, plan fetching, or email sending), it is logged using the `winston` logger, and a `500` response is returned with the error message.

### 10. **Transaction Verification Function**
   - The `verifyTransaction` function makes an API request to Flutterwave’s verification endpoint using the transaction reference (`tx_ref`) and the secret API key.
   - If the verification is successful, the response will contain a success status, and if not, it returns a failure status.

### 11. **Server Setup**
   - Finally, the app starts a server and listens on the defined port (`PORT`), which defaults to 3000.

---

### Flow Summary:
1. The customer makes a payment.
2. The payment data is sent to the `/payment-confirmation` endpoint.
3. The transaction is created with status `0` (Pending).
4. The payment is verified with Flutterwave.
5. If the payment is successful:
   - Plans are processed, codes are redeemed, and an email with codes is sent.
6. The transaction status is updated to `1` (Success), or `2` (Failed) if the verification fails.
7. Logs are created for all important steps and errors.
